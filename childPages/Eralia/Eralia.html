Eralia is an RPG about Sacred Stones that bring magic to the world, as well as deadly monsters.
You play as a boy named Kieran, (obviously) who finds a Stone and it links to him due to touching it.
Kieran, along with many teammates, are Kaimans inhabiting Eralia.
Kaimans are part human/nonhuman creatures who mature very quickly compared to humans, reaching maturity at age 10 and continuing to live until 50-70 years.
You and your friends go to find the other Stones to save the continent that the Stones doomed after being disturbed.
once all the stones are together, sacrifice one of their holders, along with the stones themselves, and destroy every monster that wills doom upon Eralia.
