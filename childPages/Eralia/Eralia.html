Eralia is an RPG about Sacred Stones that bring magic to the world, as well as deadly monsters.
You play as a boy named Kieran, (obviously) who finds a Stone and touches it, bringing monsters to the world, and unlocking magical powers once lost to time.
Kieran, along with many teammates, are Kaimans inhabiting Eralia.
Kaimans are part human/nonhuman creatures who mature very quickly compared to humans, reaching maturity at age 10 and continuing to live for 50-70 years.
When a Stone is disturbed, more monsters are revived, and the Stone's unique element is powered up.
Magic is not learned by leveling up but by being taught in school, by holding a magic tome, or when a Stone is touched. (Unique events and such can also let you learn it.)
Not everyone has magical potential, but those that do almost always stand out, being quite obvious since birth. (Humans are less likely to use magic.)
SOME ELEMENTS WILL NOT BE LEARNT EASILY, BUT WILL BE DEADLY! (One of the characters is and endgame necessity due to this.)
You and your friends go to find the other Stones to save the continent that the Stones doomed after being disturbed.
once all the stones are together, sacrifice one of their holders, along with the stones themselves, and destroy every monster that wills doom upon Eralia.
