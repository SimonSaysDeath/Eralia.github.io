⚡<br>
Eralia is an RPG about Sacred Stones that bring magic to the world, as well as deadly monsters.<br>
You play as a boy named Kieran, (obviously) who finds a Stone and touches it, bringing monsters to the world, and unlocking magical powers once lost to time.<br>
Kieran, along with many teammates, are Kaimans inhabiting Eralia.<br>
Kaimans are part human/nonhuman creatures who mature very quickly compared to humans, reaching maturity at age 10 and continuing to live for 50-70 years.<br>
When a Stone is disturbed, more monsters are revived, and the Stone's unique element is powered up.<br>
Magic is not learned by leveling up but by being taught in school, by holding a magic tome, or when a Stone is touched. (Unique events and such can also let you learn it.)<br>
Not everyone has magical potential, but those that do almost always stand out, being quite obvious since birth. (Humans are less likely to use magic.)<br>
SOME ELEMENTS WILL NOT BE LEARNT EASILY, BUT WILL BE DEADLY! (One of the characters is and endgame necessity due to this.)<br>
You and your friends go to find the other Stones to save the continent that the Stones doomed after being disturbed.<br>
once all the stones are together, sacrifice one of their holders, along with the stones themselves, and destroy every monster that wills doom upon Eralia.<br>
